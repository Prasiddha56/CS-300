# CS-300
What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the course projects I created and executed a computer science department based program at the ABC University (ABCU) to enable academic advisors to easily access and manage course information. This was to develop a program that would take course information in a file and format it into various data structures (vector, hashtable, binary search tree) and enable the user to print all the courses in alphabetical order or to display information and prerequisites of a particular course.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I began to divide the issue into smaller and rational steps: reading and validating course information, creating course objects, adding them to the relevant data structures, and creating functions to sort and present the results. I made comparisons between several data structures to know which one would represent the best in search and sorting. Learning about data structures was important as each structure influences the runtime performance, the amount of memory consumed, and the speed at which users will access the information, which are all important in creating scalable software.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
A key issue was file input and validation code to make sure that all courses and their requirements were properly formatted and loaded. Another thing I had to do was to ensure that prerequisites indicated legitimate course entries. These difficulties were overcome by composing elaborate pseudo code to map out the logic of the program and coding it and by testing the data step at a time. When I had problems with the organization of data, I examined the behavior of every data structure and modified my design.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The project helped me to understand that the design of algorithms matters and the appropriate data structure should be selected at the initial planning stage. I was not taught to jump directly into coding, but rather to analyse efficiency, scalability and memory trade-offs first. This strategy enabled me to be more strategic on how to handle data and maximize performance.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
These projects helped me to become a better writer of modular and maintainable pseudocode and code. Now I pay attention to the clarity of the program, the use of similar names, and the logical organization in order to make it easy to comprehend and edit it by others (including my future self). I also like the way that when data structures are used correctly they result in the flexibility of the programs - new functions, say alternative sorting or searching systems, can be added without redesign.
